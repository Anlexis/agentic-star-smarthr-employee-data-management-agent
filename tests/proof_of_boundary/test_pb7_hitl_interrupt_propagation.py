# PB-7 (CONDITIONAL): required only when config/config.yaml sets
# hitl.enabled: true. CMN-C2-281 is a non-HITL template (no node calls
# interrupt(); config/config.yaml declares no hitl block), so PB-7 is
# **Auto-waived - non-HITL** per docs/03_test_spec.md and both cases below
# SKIP via the module-level skipif.
#
# Canonical skip-stub form: the bodies are REAL AssertionErrors (never
# `assert True`), so if hitl.enabled is ever flipped on without implementing
# the PB-7 cases, the suite fails loudly instead of silently passing.
#
# Reference: the HITL compliance pattern (the hitl_allowed guard) - this stub is
# conditional on the template declaring HITL in its configuration.
